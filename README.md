- rest api to submit "should be blocked" website
- CMS to manage blacklisted website
- client to be installed in PC or router to block request to blacklisted website (must be distributed freely)
- the client it self can be configure to block only porn, torrent or other type
- sparated database, master database for result from crawl bot, the other is for client in the PC or router
- client database will sync daily to master database
